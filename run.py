    Are low-income areas in Chicago disproprtionately affected by PM-25 pollution? Which areas in Chicago are at high risk of Cancer 
    due to Air toxins? How do pollution levels vary in different Community Areas in Chicago?
    

    This tool supports analysis of Chicago census block group level data from the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
    The data is divided into two categories - demographic and environmental. Use the Map feature to see how your variable of 
    interest is distributed around Chicago and your Community Area. Use the Scatter plot to visualise how different variables may be corrlated 
    with each, with a line of best fit. Analyse how a variable is distributed using a histogram to identify interesting peaks and variations. 
    
    More documentation and code details are at the following github repository.
